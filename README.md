# Snake Game

This repository contains a simple browser-based Snake game implemented in
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game follows the classic Snake rules: control the
snake to eat food, which makes the snake grow longer, and avoid colliding with
walls or the snake's own body.

## Running the Game

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The game is designed to work on
desktop and mobile devices.

### Controls

- **Keyboard:** Use the arrow keys to move the snake. After a game over you can
  press any arrow key to restart immediately.
- **Mobile:** Use the on-screen arrow buttons to change direction.

## Customization

You can tweak the game's speed or grid size by editing the `speed` and
`gridSize` constants near the top of `script.js`.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – page markup and control layout
- `style.css` – basic styling for the canvas and buttons
- `script.js` – the game loop and input handling
